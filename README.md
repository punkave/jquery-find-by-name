`jquery-get-outer-html` provides a simple way to get the "outer HTML" for an element, including the element itself, even in browsers that do not support that natively. Unlike other plugins it does not include a setter for outerHTML, so it is best suited to those who do not need the extra code for a setter in their project.

## How to Use

    $('.my-element').getOuterHTML();

### Requirements

You need jQuery, of course. `jquery-getOuterHTML` is actively supported with jQuery 1.9 and 2.0 but should work fine with older versions.
